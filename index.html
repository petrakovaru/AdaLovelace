      <h3 id="headline"><strong>Here's the story of Ava Lovelace's life:</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Born two centuries ago</strong>, Ada Lovelace was a pioneer of computing science. She took part in writing the first published program and was a computing visionary, recognizing for the first time that computers could do much more than just calculations.</li>
        <li>Ada Lovelace was born in London, England, UK on <strong>December 10, 1815</strong>. She was named Augusta Ada Byron. Her surname changed after she married.</li>
        <li>In those days, there were no places for girls in the United Kingdom’s universities.
          However, girls from wealthy, aristocratic families could be educated to a high level by private tutors. And this is how Ada was educated.
          Her mother wanted Ada to concentrate particularly hard on mathematics and science</li>
        <li>Her life changed forever on June 5, 1833, when aged 17 she met Charles Babbage. This was not something many girls Ada’s age could ever do, but as an aristocrat she enjoyed better opportunities than most.</li>
        <li>Ada Lovelace had grasped that anything that could be converted into numbers, such as music, or the alphabet (language) or images, could then be manipulated by computer algorithms. An analytical engine had the potential to revolutionize the way the whole world worked, not just the world of mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>Between 1842 and 1843</strong>, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.</li>
        <li>She died of uterine cancer in <strong>1852</strong> at the age of 36.</li>
